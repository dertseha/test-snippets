### About this repository

If you want to contribute, please be aware that this repository is available under the "Unlicense".
While you'll end up in the list of contributors somewhere, there's no further recognition.

Also, this library is for things I find useful. So it might be that whatever you found useful is not for me, so I might reject your request.
